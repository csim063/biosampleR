Description: This package provides comprehensive tools for the calculation of common biodiversity indices from count data, including species richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, and Chao1. Additionally, it incorporates bootstrapping techniques to generate multiple samples, facilitating the estimation of confidence intervals around these indices. Furthermore, the package allows for the exploration of how variation in these indices changes with differing numbers of sites, making it a useful tool with which to begin an ecological analysis.
